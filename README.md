# EMGtoOMG
An EMG signal to text converter, versions 5.0+ operable for testing with or without a connected user with incoming EMG signals.

# Premise
This project was completed in the context of a university course on biomedical instrumentation and design. This tool allows a user to operate a text generation software using electrical signals generated by the contraction of their muscles. I was completely responsible for developing and troubleshooting the Python code, developing and troubleshooting the LabView visual code, and learning how Python and LabView interface.

# How it works
The Python code allows the user to navigate through and execute the available alphanumeric characters and text editting functions. LabView is a visual code, and provides the following: it is a proof-of-concept visual user interface, it accepts and filters the incoming electromyography (EMG) signals, it continuously calls specific Python functions to perform its navigation and text selection.

# Challenges
Everything in LabView runs inside of a while loop to run continuously. So, LabView calls the Python functions repeatedly (100s of times per second), and any data stored in variables in each function call are lost. Numeric values passed to the function can be modified within the function, but these modifications do not persist in as LabView continues to run. For example, a variable with an initial value of 1 in LabView is passed to a Python function, the python function adds a 1 and retuns a 2 to LabView, LabView continues, and the 2 never appears, only the original 1. I discovered that Python passes by object reference when calling a function, so storing all variables in LabView as arrays allowed for modifications done in a Python function to have a lasting effect when the call
